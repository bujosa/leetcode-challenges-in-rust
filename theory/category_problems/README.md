# Structure of The Category Problems

Those problem are organized by dependency. If the first line
is Array & Hashing, the second line depends on the first line. Excecpt
When in the final say "depends on Backtracking", it means that the problem
depends exclusive on Backtracking.

- Arrays & Hashing
- Two Pointers & Stack, does problems depend by Array & Hashing
- Linked List, Binary Search and Sliding Window 
- Trees
- Tries, Backtracking are in the same level
- Heap Priority Queue depends on Trees
- Graphs and 1-D Dynamic Programming depends on Backtracking
- Intervals, Greedy Depends ON Heap Priority Queue
- Advanced Graphs depends on Graphs and And Heap Priority Queue
- 2-D Dynamic Programming and Bit Manipulation depends on 1-D Dynamic Programming
- Math and Geometry depends on 2-D Dynamic Programming, Bit Manipulation and Graphs
