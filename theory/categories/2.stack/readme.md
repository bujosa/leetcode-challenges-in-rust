# Stack

## Theory

### Stack

- A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle.
- The last element inserted is the first one to be deleted.

### Stack Operations

- Push: Insert an element at the top of the stack.
- Pop: Delete an element at the top of the stack.
- Peek: Get the value of the top element without removing it.
- IsEmpty: Check if the stack is empty.
- IsFull: Check if the stack is full.

### Stack Applications

- Balancing of symbols
- Infix to Postfix/Prefix conversions
- Redo-undo features at many places like editors, photoshop.
- Forward and backward feature in web browsers
- Used in many algorithms like Tower of Hanoi, tree traversals, stock span problem, histogram problem.
